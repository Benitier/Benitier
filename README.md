- 👋 Hi, I’m @Benitier
- 👀 I’m Passionate about merging art, interior design, and fashion to create unique, immersive experiences. Eager to push creative boundaries, transforming spaces into expressive and meaningful environments.
- 🌱 I’m currently working as a Visual Designer at JKK International Africa Ltd, where I specialize in creating 3D designs for customized stands, exhibition booths, and interior designs. I'm also continuing to develop RASA Designs, my own creative venture, focused on art, interior design, and fashion.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that blend art, interior design, and fashion, focusing on creating innovative and immersive spaces. My goal is to work with like-minded creatives who are eager to push boundaries and explore new possibilities in design. Together, we can transform ordinary spaces into extraordinary experiences that tell compelling stories.

- ⚡ Fun fact: My creative journey started with painting on canvas, but it quickly evolved into designing spaces that tell stories and evoke emotions. Every project I take on feels like bringing a piece of art to life!
